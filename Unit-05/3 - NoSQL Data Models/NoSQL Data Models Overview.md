# NoSQL Data Models Overview

[[NoSQL Databases|NoSQL databases]] utilize various data models that differ significantly from the tabular structure of [[RDBMS]]. The main types are:

1.  **[[Key-Value Stores]]**: Simple pairs of keys and values.
2.  **[[Document Stores]]**: Store complex documents (e.g., [[JSON]], [[BSON]]).
3.  **[[Column-Family Stores]]** (Wide-Column Stores): Column-oriented storage.
4.  **[[Graph Databases]]**: Focus on nodes and relationships.

Each model offers different trade-offs in terms of [[Schema|flexibility]], query capabilities, performance characteristics, and [[Scalability (Horizontal vs Vertical)|scalability]].
