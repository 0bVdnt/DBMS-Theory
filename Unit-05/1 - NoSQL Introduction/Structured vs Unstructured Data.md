# Structured vs. Unstructured Data

*   **Structured Data**: Highly organized data with a predefined format ([[Schema]]), typically stored in tables with rows and columns (e.g., [[RDBMS]]). Easy to query and process. Examples: Customer records, financial transactions.

*   **Unstructured Data**: Data without a predefined model or organization. Examples: Text documents, emails, images, videos, social media posts, sensor data. Makes up the vast majority of data generated today.

*   **Semi-structured Data**: Has some organizational properties (e.g., tags, metadata) but doesn't fit a rigid relational schema. Examples: [[JSON]], [[XML]], [[BSON]].

## NoSQL Relevance

[[NoSQL Databases|NoSQL databases]] excel at handling semi-structured and sometimes unstructured data due to their flexible data models, whereas [[RDBMS]] are primarily designed for structured data.
