# What is NoSQL?

NoSQL originally stood for "Non SQL" or "Non Relational," but has evolved to mean "Not Only SQL." It represents a broad class of database management systems that differ significantly from the classic [[RDBMS|relational database model (RDBMS)]].

## Key Characteristics:

*   Often [[Schema|Schema-less]] or have flexible schemas.
*   Typically designed for distributed environments ([[Scalability (Horizontal vs Vertical)|horizontal scaling]]).
*   May relax [[ACID Properties|ACID properties]] (especially strict [[Consistency]]) in favor of [[BASE Properties]].
*   Use varied [[NoSQL Data Models Overview|data models]] (Key-Value, Document, Column-Family, Graph).
*   Often feature simpler query interfaces than full [[SQL]] (though this is evolving).
*   Many are open-source.
