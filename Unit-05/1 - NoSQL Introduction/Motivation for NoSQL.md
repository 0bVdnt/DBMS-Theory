# Motivation for NoSQL

NoSQL databases emerged primarily due to the challenges posed by "web scale" applications (like Google, Facebook, Amazon) dealing with:

*   **[[Big Data]]**: Massive volumes, high velocity (speed of generation/processing), and wide variety ([[Structured vs Unstructured Data|structured, semi-structured, unstructured]]) of data.
*   **[[Scalability (Horizontal vs Vertical)|Scalability]]**: Need to handle massive growth in data and user load efficiently, often requiring distribution across many commodity servers ([[Scalability (Horizontal vs Vertical)|horizontal scaling/scale-out]]) rather than upgrading single large servers ([[Scalability (Horizontal vs Vertical)|vertical scaling/scale-up]]).
*   **[[Schema|Flexibility]]**: Need for dynamic or flexible schemas to accommodate rapidly evolving applications and diverse data types without complex migrations.
*   **[[Availability]]**: High uptime requirements, often prioritizing availability over strict, immediate [[Consistency]] across all nodes. (See [[CAP Theorem]])
*   **Performance**: Fast key-value lookups and massive write performance needed for certain applications.
