# Logical Databases (Deductive Databases)

*   **Concept:** Databases based on principles of formal logic. Data is represented as facts and rules.
*   **Components:**
    *   *Facts:* Statements asserted to be true (like tuples).
    *   *Rules:* Define how new facts can be inferred (e.g., using Datalog).
    *   *Inference Engine:* Applies rules to facts to deduce information.
*   **Querying:** Asks if facts are true or requests variable bindings based on logical statements and deductions.
*   **Advantages:** Powerful declarative querying, natural representation of complex relationships and recursion.
*   **Use Cases:** Expert systems, semantic web, knowledge representation.
