**1. Advanced Database Models**

*   **Object-Oriented Database (OODB / OODBMS):** (Text Pages 2-4)
    *   **Concept:** Database systems designed to work directly with object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, methods/behavior). Objects are stored persistently.
    *   **Core Idea:** Overcomes the "impedance mismatch" between object-oriented languages (like Java, C++) and relational databases, which require mapping objects to tables/rows. Provides a single language interface.
    *   **Features & Advantages:**
        *   *Enriched Modeling:* Models complex real-world entities and relationships naturally using objects, encapsulation (state+behavior), and inheritance. Handles complex objects well.
        *   *Extensibility:* Allows defining new data types based on existing ones (classes inheriting from superclasses), promoting code reuse and easier maintenance.
        *   *Handling Variety of Data Types:* Capable of storing diverse data types (e.g., text, numbers, multimedia like pictures, video, audio) directly within objects.
        *   *Expressive Query Language:* Often uses navigational access (following object references) which can be more intuitive for certain queries (e.g., recursive queries, parts explosion) than SQL's set-oriented approach. Some also offer object-oriented SQL variants (OQL).
        *   *Schema Evolution:* Potentially easier to manage schema changes due to tight coupling between data and application (class definitions).
        *   *Support for Long-Duration Transactions:* Often incorporate protocols better suited for long, complex transactions common in CAD/CASE applications than traditional short-transaction RDBMS locking.
        *   *Improved Performance (for certain tasks):* Benchmarks suggested significant performance gains over RDBMS for complex, navigation-heavy operations due to direct object manipulation and potentially better caching ("pointer swizzling").
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   *Lack of Universal Data Model:* No single, universally accepted standard model like the relational model.
        *   *Lack of Experience/Standards:* Less widespread adoption and experience compared to RDBMS. Lack of a universal standard query language like SQL.
        *   *Competition:* Strong competition from established RDBMS and emerging ORDBMS. SQL is a well-entrenched standard.
        *   *Query Optimization Complexity:* Optimizing navigational or object-oriented queries can be complex and potentially compromise encapsulation.
        *   *Locking Granularity:* Locking at the object level can cause performance issues, especially with inheritance hierarchies.
        *   *Complexity & Cost:* Increased functionality leads to more complex and potentially expensive systems.
        *   *Limited View Support:* Often lack the robust view mechanisms found in RDBMS.
        *   *Limited Security Support:* Granular security (access rights on individual objects/classes) might be less developed.
    *   **Approaches:** (Text Page 2)
        1.  Store objects created by OOLs (C++, Java). May require an object manager layer on top of a relational store or use a native object store.
        2.  Provide OO facilities to non-OOL users (e.g., C, Pascal). Requires a translation layer.

*   **Object-Relational Database (ORDBMS):** (Text Pages 5-6)
    *   **Concept:** A hybrid approach extending the relational model with object-oriented features. Aims to leverage the stability and ubiquity of RDBMS while incorporating richer data modeling capabilities.
    *   **Core Idea:** Add support for complex objects, user-defined types (UDTs), inheritance, and methods/functions directly within the SQL/relational framework.
    *   **Features:**
        *   Retains relational foundation (tables, SQL).
        *   Supports complex data types (e.g., arrays, ROW types).
        *   Allows User-Defined Types (UDTs) and associated methods/functions that can be used in SQL queries.
        *   Supports type inheritance (subtypes).
        *   Can store methods (procedures, triggers) in the database.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   *Reuse and Sharing:* Leverages existing relational technology and experience. Allows extending the server centrally.
        *   *Increased Productivity:* Offers richer modeling capabilities than pure RDBMS.
        *   *Evolutionary Path:* Allows organizations using RDBMS to adopt OO features gradually without abandoning existing investments.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   *Complexity and Cost:* More complex than pure RDBMS.
        *   *Loss of Simplicity:* Some argue it compromises the simplicity and theoretical purity of the relational model.
        *   *Semantic Gap:* Still can be a mismatch between true object-oriented application models and the extended relational model.
    *   **Positioning:** Occupies a space between pure RDBMS and pure OODBMS, often suitable for applications needing complex data handling but within a predominantly relational context.

*   **Logical Databases (Deductive Databases):**
    *   **Concept:** Databases based on principles of formal logic. Data is represented as facts and rules.
    *   **Components:**
        *   *Facts:* Statements asserted to be true (similar to tuples in a relation).
        *   *Rules:* Define how new facts can be inferred from existing facts (often expressed in a language like Datalog, similar to Prolog).
        *   *Inference Engine:* Applies the rules to the facts to deduce new information and answer queries.
    *   **Querying:** Queries ask if a certain fact is true or ask for variable bindings that make a logical statement true. The system uses the facts and rules to deduce the answer.
    *   **Advantages:** Powerful declarative querying, ability to represent complex relationships and recursive queries naturally.
    *   **Use Cases:** Expert systems, semantic web reasoning, knowledge representation, integrity constraint checking. Less common in mainstream commercial applications compared to relational or NoSQL.

*   **Web Databases:**
    *   **Concept:** Refers more to the architecture and application context than a fundamentally distinct database *model*. It's a database system designed to be accessed and manipulated via the World Wide Web.
    *   **Architecture:** Typically involves a multi-tier architecture:
        1.  **Client Tier:** Web browser rendering HTML, executing JavaScript.
        2.  **Web Server Tier:** Handles HTTP requests (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
        3.  **Application Server Tier:** Executes application logic (e.g., using PHP, Python, Java, Node.js) that interacts with the database.
        4.  **Database Tier:** The backend database (can be RDBMS, NoSQL, etc.) storing application data.
    *   **Key Considerations:**
        *   *Statelessness:* HTTP is stateless; managing user sessions often requires techniques like cookies or server-side session stores (sometimes using Key-Value stores).
        *   *Security:* Prone to web-specific attacks like [[SQL Injection]] or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Requires careful input validation and secure coding practices (like using prepared statements).
        *   *Scalability & Performance:* Must handle potentially large numbers of concurrent users. Caching (at multiple levels) is crucial. Backend databases often need to be scalable (leading to the use of NoSQL or distributed RDBMS).
        *   *APIs:* Interaction between application server and database usually happens via database drivers and APIs.

**2. Distributed and Parallel Database Concepts**

*(Leverages Text Pages 6-11)*

*   **Parallel Database Systems:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve performance (processing speed, I/O speed) by executing database operations *in parallel* using multiple CPUs and disks within a tightly coupled system.
    *   **Focus:** Performance through parallelization of tasks like data loading, index building, query evaluation.
    *   **Architectures:**
        *   *Shared Memory:* Multiple processors share common main memory. Simple communication but bottleneck potential.
        *   *Shared Disk:* Processors/nodes have private memory but share disk storage (often via a SAN). Balances load but potential disk contention.
        *   *Shared Nothing:* Each processor/node has private memory *and* private disk. Data is partitioned. High scalability but requires network communication for data exchange. Most scalable architecture.
    *   **Data Distribution:** Governed primarily by performance considerations (e.g., partitioning data for parallel processing).

*   **Distributed Database Systems:**
    *   **Goal:** Allow data to be physically stored across multiple, potentially geographically dispersed, sites (nodes) that are loosely coupled (often over standard networks). Sites might be autonomous.
    *   **Focus:** Data sharing, local autonomy, increased availability/reliability by distributing data.
    *   **Architectures:**
        *   *Homogeneous:* All sites run the same type of DBMS (e.g., all Oracle).
        *   *Heterogeneous:* Sites run different DBMS types (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server, non-relational). Requires gateways or mediators for interoperability.
    *   **Transparency:** Aim to hide the distribution details from the user/application (location, replication, fragmentation transparency).
    *   **Key Challenges:** Distributed query processing, distributed transaction management (e.g., two-phase commit), consistency across replicas, catalog management.

*   **Parallel vs. Distributed:**
    *   **Coupling:** Parallel = Tightly coupled (often high-speed interconnect), Distributed = Loosely coupled (standard network).
    *   **Autonomy:** Parallel nodes = Non-autonomous, Distributed sites = Often autonomous.
    *   **Primary Goal:** Parallel = Performance, Distributed = Availability/Sharing/Autonomy.
    *   *Convergence:* The lines blur, especially with shared-nothing parallel systems and high-performance distributed systems. Many NoSQL systems are inherently both parallel (within nodes) and distributed (across nodes).

**3. Data Warehousing**

*(Leverages Text Pages 11-17)*

*   **Concept:** A central repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources (operational systems, external data). Stores current and historical data, optimized for querying, reporting, and analysis (OLAP - Online Analytical Processing), rather than transactional processing (OLTP).
*   **Definition (Inmon):** "A warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision making process."
    *   *Subject-Oriented:* Data organized around major subjects (e.g., customer, product, sales) rather than ongoing operations.
    *   *Integrated:* Data from different sources is made consistent (naming conventions, units, encoding).
    *   *Time-Variant:* Data represents snapshots over time; historical perspective is key. Records retain timestamp information.
    *   *Non-Volatile:* Data is typically loaded and refreshed periodically, but not updated or deleted transactionally like in OLTP systems. Historical data is preserved.
*   **Benefits:** Decision support, business intelligence, trend analysis, consistent view across business units, offloading reporting load from OLTP systems.
*   **Characteristics:** Database designed for analytical tasks, content updated periodically, contains historical data.
*   **Architecture Components:** (Text Page 18-19)
    *   *Source Systems:* Operational databases (OLTP), legacy systems, external data feeds.
    *   *Data Staging Area:* Intermediate storage for ETL processes.
    *   *ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process:* Extracts data from sources, Transforms/Cleanses it (handles inconsistencies, standardizes formats, ensures quality - [[Data Cleansing]]), and Loads it into the warehouse. (Text Page 20-21)
    *   *Presentation Server / Data Warehouse:* The actual storage, often using dimensional modeling (star/snowflake schemas) optimized for analysis. May include data marts (subsets for specific departments).
    *   *Meta Data Repository:* Stores "data about data" - definitions, sources, transformations, schemas, usage statistics. Crucial for management and understanding.
    *   *End-User Access Tools:* Query/reporting tools, OLAP tools, data mining tools, dashboards.
*   **Design & Management:** Involves choosing subject matter, designing fact/dimension tables, handling slowly changing dimensions, managing security, monitoring updates, backup/recovery, purging old data. (Text Page 13-14)

**4. Data Mining**

*(Leverages Text Pages 22-24)*

*   **Concept:** The process of discovering interesting, non-trivial, previously unknown, and potentially useful patterns or knowledge from large amounts of data. Often performed on data stored in a [[Data Warehousing|Data Warehouse]]. Part of the broader Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process.
*   **Goal:** To find hidden patterns, correlations, anomalies, and trends to support decision-making, prediction, or understanding.
*   **Architecture:** (Text Page 22) Typically involves accessing a data source (DB, DW), preprocessing data, applying mining algorithms using a data mining engine (guided by domain knowledge/knowledge base), evaluating discovered patterns, and presenting results via a GUI.
*   **Functions/Tasks:** (Text Page 23)
    *   *Classification:* Assigning items to predefined categories based on their features (e.g., classifying emails as spam/not spam).
    *   *Clustering:* Grouping similar items together without predefined categories (e.g., customer segmentation).
    *   *Association Rule Mining:* Discovering relationships between items (e.g., "customers who buy diapers also tend to buy beer" - market basket analysis).
    *   *Sequencing/Sequential Pattern Mining:* Finding patterns that occur over time (e.g., sequence of web pages visited before a purchase).
    *   *Regression/Forecasting:* Predicting continuous values based on historical data (e.g., predicting house prices, demand forecasting).
    *   *Anomaly Detection:* Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., fraud detection).
*   **Applications:** (Text Page 24) Widely used in business (CRM, marketing, fraud detection, risk analysis), science (bioinformatics, astronomy), web (search engines), government (security, tax analysis).

**5. Introduction to Big Data & Hadoop Ecosystem**

*   **Big Data:**
    *   **Concept:** Datasets whose size, speed of generation, and complexity are beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze efficiently.
    *   **The "V"s:** Often characterized by:
        *   *Volume:* Terabytes, Petabytes, Exabytes or more.
        *   *Velocity:* High speed of data generation and need for rapid processing (e.g., streaming data).
        *   *Variety:* Different forms of data – [[Structured vs Unstructured Data|structured, semi-structured, unstructured]] (text, logs, multimedia, sensor data).
        *   *(Often added) Veracity:* Uncertainty or trustworthiness of data.
        *   *(Often added) Value:* The potential business or scientific value derivable from the data.
    *   **Drivers:** Internet (web logs, social media), mobile devices, IoT sensors, scientific instruments.

*   **Hadoop (Introduction):**
    *   **Definition:** Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing and processing [[Big Data]] in a distributed environment across clusters of commodity hardware.
    *   **Core Idea:** Inspired by Google papers on GFS (Google File System) and MapReduce. Provides fault-tolerant distributed storage and a parallel processing model.
    *   **Goal:** To enable scalable, reliable, and cost-effective analysis of massive datasets.

*   **Building Blocks / Components of Hadoop:**
    *   **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):**
        *   *Role:* The primary storage system of Hadoop. A fault-tolerant, high-throughput distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware.
        *   *Architecture:* Master/slave architecture.
            *   *NameNode:* Master server managing the file system namespace (metadata) and regulating access to files by clients. Knows where data blocks are located.
            *   *DataNodes:* Slave servers storing the actual data blocks. Typically one per node in the cluster. Data blocks are replicated (usually 3x by default) across different DataNodes for fault tolerance.
        *   *Characteristics:* Optimized for large files and streaming data access (write-once, read-many pattern). Not suited for low-latency random access or many small files.
    *   **MapReduce (Hadoop V1 Processing Engine):**
        *   *Role:* The original parallel processing framework in Hadoop for processing large datasets across a cluster.
        *   *Model:* Divides computation into two main phases:
            1.  **Map Phase:** Input data is split and processed in parallel by map tasks. Each map task takes a key-value pair as input and produces intermediate key-value pairs. `map(key1, value1) -> list(key2, value2)`
            2.  **Reduce Phase:** Intermediate key-value pairs are shuffled and sorted based on the intermediate key. Reduce tasks process all values associated with the same intermediate key to produce the final output. `reduce(key2, list(value2)) -> list(key3, value3)`
        *   *Execution:* Managed by JobTracker (master) and TaskTrackers (slaves) in Hadoop V1.
        *   *Limitations:* Primarily batch-oriented, can have high latency, relatively complex programming model, inefficient for iterative or interactive tasks. (Largely superseded by frameworks like Spark, Tez, Flink, but the *concept* is fundamental).
    *   **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator - Hadoop V2+):**
        *   *Role:* Separates resource management from job scheduling/monitoring, making Hadoop more general-purpose. Replaces the JobTracker/TaskTracker model.
        *   *Components:* ResourceManager (global resource manager), NodeManager (per-node agent). Allows different processing frameworks (MapReduce, Spark, Tez, Flink) to run on the same Hadoop cluster.

*   **HBase:**
    *   **Definition:** An open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational ([[Column-Family Stores|column-family]]) database modeled after Google's Bigtable. Runs on top of [[HDFS]].
    *   **Characteristics:** Provides low-latency random read/write access to huge datasets. Sparse (rows can have different columns), distributed, persistent, multi-dimensional sorted map. Good for use cases needing fast lookups and updates within massive tables.

*   **Hive:**
    *   **Definition:** A data warehouse software project built on top of Hadoop for providing data query and analysis.
    *   **Functionality:** Provides an [[SQL]]-like interface called HiveQL (HQL) to query data stored in various formats on [[HDFS]] or in [[HBase]]. It translates HQL queries into execution plans, often involving [[MapReduce]], Tez, or [[Spark]] jobs running on the cluster. Facilitates ETL, reporting, and data analysis on Big Data. Uses a metastore (often a traditional RDBMS) to store schema information ("schema-on-read").

*   **Spark (Apache Spark):**
    *   **Definition:** A fast, general-purpose cluster computing system. Provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R.
    *   **Advantages over MapReduce:** Significantly faster due to in-memory processing capabilities (using Resilient Distributed Datasets - RDDs, and later DataFrames/Datasets). More flexible programming model. Supports various workloads beyond batch processing, including interactive queries (Spark SQL), streaming data (Spark Streaming), machine learning (MLlib), and graph processing (GraphX).
    *   **Integration:** Can run on Hadoop [[YARN]] and read/write data from [[HDFS]], [[HBase]], [[Hive]], and many other sources. Often used as a replacement or complement to Hadoop MapReduce.

*   **SSD (Solid State Drives):**
    *   **Technology:** Storage devices using integrated circuit assemblies (flash memory) to store data persistently. No moving mechanical parts like traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs).
    *   **Impact on Databases & Big Data:**
        *   *Performance:* Offer significantly lower latency (faster access times) and much higher Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) compared to HDDs.
        *   *Benefits:* Drastically speeds up database operations sensitive to I/O bottlenecks, including query execution, index lookups, transaction logging, and data loading. Benefits both traditional DBMS and Big Data systems (e.g., faster MapReduce shuffles, quicker HBase random reads, improved Spark caching/shuffle performance).
        *   *Usage:* Increasingly used for database storage, caching layers, temporary file storage (e.g., for Spark shuffles), and metadata storage (like HDFS NameNode metadata or HBase WALs).

*   **Cloudera:**
    *   **Definition:** A major enterprise software company that provides Apache Hadoop-based software, support, services, and training.
    *   **Role:** Offers a commercial distribution of Hadoop and related projects (like [[Hive]], [[HBase]], [[Spark]], Impala, etc.), often packaged with management tools (Cloudera Manager), security features (Sentry), and other enterprise enhancements. It's an *example* of how open-source Big Data technologies are packaged for enterprise use (other examples include Hortonworks - now merged with Cloudera, MapR, Amazon EMR, Microsoft Azure HDInsight).
