# Big Data Introduction

*   **Concept:** Datasets whose size, speed, or complexity exceed the capabilities of traditional database tools for capture, storage, management, and analysis.
*   **The "V"s:** Characterized by:
    *   **[[Volume]]**: Massive scale (Terabytes, Petabytes+).
    *   **[[Velocity]]**: High speed of generation and processing needs (streaming).
    *   **[[Variety]]**: Different forms - [[Structured vs Unstructured Data|structured, semi-structured, unstructured]] (text, logs, media, sensors).
    *   *(Often added) Veracity*: Uncertainty/trustworthiness.
    *   *(Often added) Value*: Potential business/scientific worth.
*   **Drivers:** Internet (web, social), mobile, [[IoT]], scientific instruments.
*   **Technologies:** Often handled by frameworks like [[Hadoop Introduction|Hadoop]] and associated ecosystem tools ([[HDFS]], [[MapReduce]], [[Spark]], [[NoSQL Databases]]). Requires [[Scalability (Horizontal vs Vertical)|horizontal scalability]].
