# Data Mining

*   **Concept:** The process of discovering interesting, non-trivial, previously unknown, and potentially useful patterns or knowledge from large amounts of data. Often performed on data from a [[Data Warehousing|Data Warehouse]]. Part of the broader [[Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)|Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)]] process.
*   **Goal:** To find hidden patterns, correlations, anomalies, and trends to support decision-making, prediction, or understanding.
*   **Architecture:** Typically involves accessing a data source (DB, DW), preprocessing, applying mining algorithms (data mining engine), evaluating patterns, and presenting results.
*   **Related Concepts:** [[Data Warehousing]], [[Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)]], [[Data Mining Functions]].
*   **Applications:** Business (CRM, marketing, fraud detection), science, web, government.
