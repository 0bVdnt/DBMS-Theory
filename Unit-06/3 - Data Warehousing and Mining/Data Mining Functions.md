# Data Mining Functions

Common tasks performed in [[Data Mining]]:

*   **Classification:** Assigning items to predefined categories (e.g., spam detection).
*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar items without predefined categories (e.g., customer segmentation).
*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items (e.g., market basket analysis - "if diapers then beer").
*   **Sequencing/Sequential Pattern Mining:** Finding patterns over time (e.g., web page visit sequences).
*   **Regression/Forecasting:** Predicting continuous values (e.g., predicting prices, demand forecasting).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying outliers or unusual data points (e.g., fraud detection).

These functions are applied using various algorithms to extract insights from data, often stored in a [[Data Warehousing|Data Warehouse]].
